# Samples of CMAs 
IN this repository we have some samples of each type of the introduced CMAs:

Note:
We have two types of datasets: before the launch of CMAs and after the launch of CMAs.
Each data set consists of two parts: the demand and the available times.
Regarding the available time, it should be mentioned that it is defined with vectors containing 0 and 1 values. The first "1" value indicates the start time, and the last "1" value shows the end time of the requested charging demand.
