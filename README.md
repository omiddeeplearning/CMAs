# Samples of CMAs 
This repository includes 5000 samples of each type of the introduced CMAs:

Note:
We have two types of datasets: before the launch of CMAs and after the launch of CMAs.
Each data set consists of two parts: the demand and the available times.

Regarding the available time, it should be mentioned that it is defined with binary vectors (containing 0 and 1 values). The first "1" value indicates the start time, and the last "1" value shows the end time of the requested charging demand (five-minute time intervals).

The requested demand is also presented in kWh.
